#### What’s Nuxt for JAMstack? By Tamas Piros
During the talk we’ll take a look at a demo JAMstack site created using Nuxt.js, Strapi and Cloudinary. We’ll discuss and reiterate the importance of headless CMS, Static Site Generators and the usage of APIs in order to create an application that not only performs incredibly well (even under bad network conditions) but can also act as a Progressive Web Application.
